    "While we all would love to think our teammates will be around forever, or at least for the life of the company. The truth is sometimes life has other plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common scenario for GitGuardian customers, especially when doing historical scans, is that the developer who originally committed the code is long gone. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents two major problems for an organization:\n",
    "1 - The need to know how many incidents are affected and get a report of each one.\n",
    "2 - Since the dev is gone, the incidents most likely need to be assigned to someone who has deeper familiarity with the projects involved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following scripts are examples that can help solve these issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is written to be run manually and makes certain assumptions about your manager/owner access to both Okta and GitGuardian. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is all in the experimental stages but has been tested and works on my machine. \n"
