    "\n",
    "While we cover many of the API calls available, it does not touch on all of them. For the full list, see the full [API reference documentation](https://api.gitguardian.com/docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A note if you are new to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/): Each code block is run on demand, but are all run within the same program, sharing the same memory. This means variables set in one block are callable from each following block. If you get output that says something is undefined, make sure you ran the block that defines it. \n",

    "## 1. Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the GitGuardian API, you will need to create a [new personal access token](https://docs.gitguardian.com/api-docs/personal-access-tokens). See the documentation for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to create and use a Personal Access Token for this notebook:\n",
    "- Go to your GitGuardian dashboard and click on API, then select the Person Access Tokens menu.\n",
    "- Create a new access token with the selected scope: \n",
    "    - scan \n",
    "    - incidnet:read\n",
    "    - incidnet:write\n",
    "    - incidnet:share\n",
    "    - members:read\n",
    "- Copy the new token to the clipboard. \n",
    "- *_Do not_* paste it into this document.\n",
    "- Create a new file in your project called \"authorization.py\" and add the following line and save the file:\n",
    "    - token = 'Paste-Your-GG-API-Token-Here'\n",
    "- Double check your `.gitignore` file to make sure this stays out of your source control. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ALTERNATIVELY - set up and use Hashicorp Vault or another such credentials manager. This is overall a better path, but let's keep things simple for this example repo.\n",
